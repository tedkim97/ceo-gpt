CeoGPT is our flagship, 3 quintillion parameter LLM meant to replace the CEOs. Our model has been trained on interviews, books, and tweets from the greatest thinkers and leaders such as: Adam Neumann, Charlie Javice, Elizabeth Holmes, Jack Welch, Jeffrey Skilling, Martin Shkreli, Sam Bankman-Fried and many more. 

As we were brainstorming in the lab, we found ourselves confronted with one of society’s biggest dilemmas. After AI has replaced workers, artists, and even our friends and family, what does we do? We were stuck in the lab, ideating and when our revelation hit. Our mission will be complete when we replace the last human: the CEO. Enter CeoGPT, a cold, calculating, cruel algorithm that’s designed to do what human CEOs can't: run on electricity. 

At the low price of 1,400 USD per hour, CeoGPT costs less than the median salary of a S&P 500 CEO. No more relying on inconsistent, reckless executives. Now CeoGPT can make these mistakes for us.
